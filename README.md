# Shashwat Agrawal

**Systems engineer • Toolsmith • OSS contributor**

I build low-level tools, runtimes, and infra from scratch,  mostly in C, Rust, and Python.

No frameworks. No fluff. Just fast, predictable systems.
> (Also yes, I use Arch, Neovim, and i3 btw.)

## Interests

- Systems programming, runtimes, and compilers  
- Concurrency, I/O, and performance tuning  
- Clean, minimal abstractions over raw power
